This directory contains a Qt-style wrapper library for OpenCL
plus several examples, benchmarks, and unit tests that exercise
the library in various ways.

It is recommended that you use Qt 4.7, but the library will build
with Qt 4.6.  The main missing feature is support for QGLBuffer
in the QCLContextGL class - that class is in Qt 4.7, but not 4.6.

There are a number of variables that can be provided to qmake:

QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL
    Directory that contains the includes <CL/cl.h>, <CL/cl_gl.h>, etc.
QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL
    Directory that contains the libOpenCL.so library.
QMAKE_LIBS_OPENCL
    Libraries to add to the link line.  e.g. "-lOpenCL -lGLESv2".  The
    default value is "-lOpenCL".
CONFIG+=no_cl_gl
    The OpenCL library does not have any of the functions that
    are needed to perform OpenGL integration.  This will cause the
    sharing functionality of QCLContextGL to be disabled.

For example:
    qmake QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL=abc QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL=def

Note: you should use the full pathname to the "qmake" binary in the
version of Qt you built from sources.  For example, if you built Qt 4.7
in $HOME/build/qt-47, then you would run qmake as follows:

    $HOME/build/qt-47/bin/qmake QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL=abc QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL=def

For the N900, it is recommended that QMAKE_LIBS_OPENCL be set to
"-lOCL" and that "CONFIG+=no_cl_gl" be supplied to qmake; e.g.

    qmake QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL=$HOME/libocl/usr/include \
          QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL=$HOME/libocl/usr/lib \
          QMAKE_LIBS_OPENCL="-lOCL" \
          CONFIG+=no_cl_gl

Where the N900's libocl package has been unpacked into $HOME/libocl
on the build machine.
