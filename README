This directory contains a Qt-style wrapper library for OpenCL
plus several examples, benchmarks, and unit tests that exercise
the library in various ways.

It is recommended that you build Qt 4.7 from sources and use that to build
the library, rather than use the SDK version of Qt.  This is because
the library needs access to private header files from the Qt sources
which are not part of the SDK.

There are a number of variables that can be provided to qmake:

QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL
    Directory that contains the includes <CL/cl.h>, <CL/cl_gl.h>, etc.
QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL
    Directory that contains the libOpenCL.so library.
QMAKE_LIBS_OPENCL
    Libraries to add to the link line.  e.g. "-lOpenCL -lGLESv2".  The
    default value is "-lOpenCL".

For example:
    qmake QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL=abc QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL=def

Note: you should use the full pathname to the "qmake" binary in the
version of Qt you built from sources.  For example, if you built Qt 4.7
in $HOME/build/qt-47, then you would run qmake as follows:

    $HOME/build/qt-47/bin/qmake QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL=abc QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL=def

For the N900, it is recommended that QMAKE_LIBS_OPENCL be set to
"-lOCL -lGLESv2".  Also, you may need to modify your <CL/cl_gl.h> file
to change "#include <GL/gl.h>" to "#include <GLES2/gl2.h>".
