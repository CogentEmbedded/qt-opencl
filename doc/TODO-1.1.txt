Items to do for OpenCL 1.1
==========================

Kernels
-------

- Use preferredWorkSizeMultiple() to determine best 2D/3D sizes.

Memory objects
--------------

- clEnqueueReadBufferRect(), clEnqueueWriteBufferRect(), and
  clEnqueueCopyBufferRect() -> should be able to implement as overloads
  to QCLBuffer::read(), write(), and copyTo(), with fallback implementations
  for OpenCL 1.0.
